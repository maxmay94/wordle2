# WORDLE 2

A remake of the hit game Wordle, originally created by Josh Wardle, recently acquired by the New York Times. I have added a few new features of my own though.

## Getting Started 🏁

[Play Wordle 2 Here](https://maxmay94.github.io/wordle2/)

#### Located in the options menu :

*  Music : toggle the games music on / off
*  New Game : Start a new game
*  Stats : See your stats
*  Level 1 - 5 : change difficulty level
*  Search ID# : Type code to play a specific word. These codes can be found at the end of the game in the Share Screen
*  Start game using ID# 
*  Share : get the word code and shareable emoji

### How to play 🟩 ⬜️ ⬜️ 🟧 🟩

- To start: guess any 5 letter word
  - Letters that are not in the word appear grey
  - Letters that are in the word, but the wrong position will appear orange
  - Letters in the correct position will appear green
  - <em>**this is true in every case for both the gameboard and the keyboard**</em>
- Continue guessing until either you've solved the word or have failed
- At the end of the game a scren will appear that will let you share your results, and challenge a friend to play the same word using a code number
